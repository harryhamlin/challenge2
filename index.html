            My name is Harry Hamlin and I'm a business leader. My work styles are: my interests are: my inspirations are:
            <br>
            <br>
            I've spent the past 10 years working professionally in the outdoor industry. I spent the first several years of my professional life working as a shift supervisor on ski patrol at Crystal Mountain in Washington and a professional climbing guide internationally.  Through my work, I was able to reach the summit of Everest, Lhotse, and Mt Rainier over 50 times. For the past 2 years I have work as the director of opperations at International Mountain Guides, managing the company's staff of over 50 guides and operations of all domestic and international expeditions. Throughout my experiences I've developed excellent leadership and problemsolving skills as well as a desire to foster growth and mentorship. I've had the opportunity to execute many technical projects, including the creation and systematic implementation of a custom built registration system and a collaborative ATF compliant data collection system.
